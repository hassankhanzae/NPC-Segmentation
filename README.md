# Patch-Based Enhanced Unified Net for Accurate Segmentation of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in 3D MR Images

This repository includes the Nasophyrangeal Carcinoma Segmentation Python code utilized in our proposed study's analyses.  Only a limited amount of samples are available in this repository; the dataset is private and cannot be shared.

Our code can run smoothly using these dependencies.
1. Pytorch Implementation pytorch 11.9
2. Cuda 12.3
3. Jupyter Notebook 7.3
   
Proposed model can be can be trained using main.ipynb jupyter notebook file. The predictive GTV mask folder contains the extrated slices segmentation results.

Note: If you don't use the provided dependencies. You may face some errors in the code.
